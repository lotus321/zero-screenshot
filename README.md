# xscreenshot

This is a screenshot tool built by stripping down xannonate's xscreenshot tool, and attaching farbfeld on the end.

To use it you need to the ff2png from farbfeld installed in PATH, as well as the xscreenshot binary from here. Then call the ./screenshot script.

There is a desktop file too.
